# Project File Sorter
Utility program that helps you keep track of and organise your project files, and eventual exports.

Created many for the users of music software projects, which are prone to mulitple project versions and exports.
Currently only supports fl studio files.

Planned features:
- Automatic files sorting!!!
- project of the day
- A way to see if project has been exported before
- How many versions of that project exist
